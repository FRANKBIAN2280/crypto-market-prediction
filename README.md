# 🪙 Bitcoin Price Prediction Project

This project aims to **analyze and predict Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices** using historical data fetched from **Yahoo Finance** via the `yfinance` Python library.  
It provides a foundation for building machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Transformer) to forecast future Bitcoin trends.
